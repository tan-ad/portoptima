# üìä PortOptima

A web application for portfolio analysis and optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).

## üìã Overview

PortOptima is a practical implementation of portfolio theory concepts that helps analyze investment portfolios and explore optimization possibilities. This tool demonstrates how MPT principles can be applied to evaluate portfolio performance, visualize risk-return relationships, and suggest potentially improved asset allocations.
